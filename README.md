# NYC Borough Shootings
This is a project that tracks and analyze shooting incidents within each of the five boroughs of New York City. Inputs and variables include the borough, ages of victims and perpetrators, race and gender of victims and perpetrators, date and time of incident, etc.

The project is designed for exploratory purposes such as discovering the "most dangerous" borough based on the proportion of total incidents across all five boroughs for a given year.
